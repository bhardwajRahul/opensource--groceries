# Specifically Clementines App - Open Source / Self Hosted

## Why another grocery list app?

Certainly there are other open source / self-hosted apps, but none had the main feature that I felt was missing from even the commercial offerings: really reliable sync. The key function my family needed was the ability to share lists across multiple devices and multiple users and have people add and check-off items with the results reflected in real-time on other devices. So many times, with other apps, the sync would just fail with no indication at all, or just stop working until a restart or account reset.

Other apps, such as grocy, are great if you are interested in keeping inventory, etc. For my purposes, though, I was much more interested in sync and the overall shopping experience, such as the ability to have multiple lists with an item able to be purchased at multiple locations, but checked off all lists once it was purchased at any one store.

## Features

* Supports multiple shopping lists and ability to group lists into a list group
* Lists can be shared with other users
* Updates across multiple platforms and users occur in real-time, synced immediately. Sync status always visible. Conflict resolution occurs automatically and can be viewed.
* Works offline as well, when you don't have internet connectivity. Updates are synced as soon as connectivity resumes.
* List Group support includes the ability to add items to a group of stores automatically, and then if the first store doesn't have an item, it remains on the list for the next store.
* Supports a sorted view of every store by category (aisle), so you don't have to double back in the store
* Recipe support, so that a group of items can be added to a shopping list at once. Includes support for importing existing recipes from [Tandoor](https://tandoor.dev)

## What's with the name?

One of my children has a very sincere and distinct preference for clementines over tangerines or any other more generic "mandarin".  She is always very specific when she puts clementines on the list.
