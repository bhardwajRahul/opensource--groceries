Application Impacts:

MIGRATION PROCESS:
  Done automatically:
    * Delete all items (no good way to migrate)
    * Update list structure 
    * Create default listgroups
  Manually:
    * Assign remaining lists to listgroups
    * Re-share list groups

Main Items screen can be in "listgroup" mode vs. "list" mode

Lists will not be in a listgroup by default -- group into a virtual "Undefined" group or something
  modification, see below: all lists will be put into a default listgroup.

Need ListGroup creator/editor page
    Can only add lists that aren't already a part of a list ListGroup. And you are the owner?
    Sharing goes here

List page:
    Remove sharing part

Items page:
    Can be filtered by list or list group
    Can the "AllItems" page just be a variant without a filter?
    If an item is on multiple lists, maybe show in a small box/font the lists?
    Auto-add functionality different:
        Automatically add to everything in the listgroup if listgroup is the filter
            Add if stocked at the store.
            Optionally also check auto-add category setting.
            Any edits to quantity would impact all list items
        Do we auto-add if the list is in a group but you select a specific list?  Probably not, then don't need a setting.
        I guess still need a setting for "complete off all lists"


Item editor:

    Should I continue to have the grid of lists the item is in?
        If so, need to add fields in the grid: quantity, category
        That's a lot for one line... maybe need repeating sections/components? Use store name as itemlistdivider
        Because also need to handle notes...

    Should there be a filter by list or list group on the page?
    Maybe you have a listgroup filter which controls which rows on the grid appear

Should not need participants checks anymore ?
change  to return listgroup as well as lists -- put logic in here for "undefined"/no listgroup name
Do I need a listowner as well as a listgroup owner?

Need to make sure before you save an item, you clean up the "list" entries and ensure all belong to the group. (?needed?)

Ungrouped concept:
  Lists start as a part of no group right now == null listGroupID
  problem here is if you create "bananas" item, it is shared across all of these.
  Not sure that is the best approach....
  Perhaps every user should get their own "default" listGroupID.
  ID could be stored with the user as well.

  Ideally create that users' default listgroupID locally and then sync back.
  That would make the functions work better in "full offline" mode.
  How could you link the user to the default list group ID then though?
    entry in todos ? if you create a listGroup entry, it would have the list

  For now, once a list is in a listgroup, it cannot move.
    Possible later addition:
        allow it to move, but only within the same listgroupowners , and even then need cleanup of items when moving
        i.e. no items move to new list, and existing items with the moved list need to have it deleted from lists array
        possibly (hopefully not...) need to add the new list to the items in the moved-to-listgroup.


Changes left to do:
D  * Major fix left is item page -- 
D    * Add concept of "set across all lists" for the top values
 D   * Then have a list of key values for each list, with a "*" to indicate that parts are different from the "master"
D    * Have modal to edit the values on an individual list
D  * When adding new list allow selection of listgroup. When editing, do not.  
D  * Go back and fix items page -- add modes
D  * Handle deleting a listgroup -- the code was written for lists not listgroups, now must delete associated lists and items
  * Maybe check default setting to make sure it's only on one listgroup at a time, and is always on one.
