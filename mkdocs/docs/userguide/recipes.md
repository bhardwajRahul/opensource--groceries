# Recipe Editor

## Recipes
In this app, a recipe is a collection of items and a set of preparation steps.  Each item can either be one of the global items that come with the app, or a custom one for the recipe. Every item has a separate "recipe" and "shopping" unit of measure and quantity. For instance, you might need 2 cups of sugar for the recipe, but you wouldn't buy 2 cups of sugar, but perhaps 1 pound.

## Recipe Import
On the Recipes list screen, you can also import a recipe from the Tandoor app. To do so, you would go to the Tandoor app, then export either 1 or a set of recipes -- this would create a .zip file, either on your computer or mobile device. In the recipe import screen, you could then select the .zip file and it would process the available recipes, and import those selected.

During recipe import, if a match cannot be made for unit of measure or other problems occurred, then a note will be added to the individual erroring item.

## Recipe Editor
Here is where you can edit/add/delete items for the recipe on the editor screen. You can search existing items on other recipes or global that can easily be added by clicking on the item in the search bar. Once added, you can click the pencil to edit quantities and units of measure for the recipe prep and shopping.

You can also just add a series of text boxes that act as instructions / recipe prep steps. Next to each item or recipe step, you can press the trash can to delete the item or instruction step.
