The menu shows first the lists and list groups available to the user. In this case, there is list group "Grocery Stores", with 2 lists - Publix and Wegman's. There is also a list group called "Hardware Stores" with 2 lists - Home Depot and Lowes.  If you click on the name of the list or list group itself, you will be taken to the item entry/checkoff screen. If you click to the right on the pencil, you will be taken to the list or list group editor screen.

Other items on the menu include options to create a new list, show/edit the list groups, show/edit recipes (including importing new ones and adding them in bulk to a list), show/edit the categories, show/edit the items (across all lists), show the global items (the ones which come pre-populated with the app) and show/edit the units of measure. Also, you can show/add friends,  view the sync "conflict" log in the rare occurence that conflicts arise, and show/change the app settings. You can also login / logout from the app.
