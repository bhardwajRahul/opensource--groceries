![](../assets/managedata.png){align=right width=300}

The manage data page allows you to access important data maintenance screens for the application. These include:

* Manage All Listgroups -- Shows all of your persondal list groups and allows them to be changed, deleted, or for you to add a new listgroup.
* Create New List -- Allows you to add a new list to a list group, and set which categories/aisles are in that list, and in which order.
* Manage Categories -- Shows all personal and global categories and allows changing colors to be displayed in the item checkoff screen.
* Manage All Items -- Allows editing of all items that you have added to a list group/list (either from the global list or your own custom new item). 
* View Global Items -- View a list of the global / built-in items that come with the application. No changes can be made to these items.
* Units of Measure -- Allows you to change global units of measure (adding alternate unit of measure abbreviations) and add/change any custom units of measure you create as well.
