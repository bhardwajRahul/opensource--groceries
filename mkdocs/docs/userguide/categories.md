You will see a list of available categories, both those that came pre-loaded with the system, as well as those that you have entered. When you click on a category here, you can edit the category.

There are not many settings available to edit. There is a color you can assign to the category as well as editing the name. Every user is able to set the color of each category for themselves. This color will show up on the item check-off screen as a colored bar under the category name.

If you are editing one of the pre-provided "Global" categories, you cannot change the name of the category, nor delete it.  When creating your own custom category, you must assign it to a list group where you want to use it. After the category is created, this list group assignment cannot be changed.
