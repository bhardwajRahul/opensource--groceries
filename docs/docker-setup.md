# Groceries App -- Docker Compose setup

## Initial setup

Use the docker-compose.yaml file from the docs directory to start with. This is setup for single-node processing, with services running on localhost. You can extrapolate from here to add reverse proxies, https/letsencrypt, etc..

* The docker-compose has 3 volumes setup as 2 subdirectories and 1 file:
    * File groceries-web-conf -- see file in docs directory for contents. Just sets up some defaults for nginx.
    * Directory ./dbdata -- will have the database files
    * Directory ./dbetclocal -- has configuration files for couchdb. Should start with two files called admin.ini which contains the startup user/password. See admin.ini in docs directory for contents.  Other file should be jwt.ini which you will need to update with your personal HMAC key (base64 encoded) on the line that starts with "hmac:_default".
* Launch the file with docker-compose up. CouchDB will start, but is not yet configured. You will need to do the following steps after it launches.
* Go to the following URL: http://localhost:5984/_utils
* Login with the user (admin/admin in the files).
* Go to the settings tab (gear on the left) and click on CORS. Enable for all domains (can be more specific if needed)
* Go to the databases tab (cylinder icon on the left). Create the _users and _replicator system databases.
* Stop the docker compose stack.
* Restart the docker compose stack (docker compose up). CouchDB will take a minute or two to start, and then the backend/server should start as well. 

## Create a user

* Navigate to http://localhost:8100.
* Choose the "CREATE ACCOUNT" button.
* Enter in all relevant details. If you wish to be able to reset your password with the UI, make sure you enter a valid email and make sure you have the email setup in the environment variables for the groceries server (SMTP_*)
